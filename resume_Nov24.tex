    \smallskip
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Served as the engineering expert on intelligence teams across multiple problem
              spaces, rapidly prototyping bespoke tools, identifying and standardizing cross-team
              solutions, and representing investigator needs to external engineering teams to
              ensure scalable, problem-specific outcomes.
              %
        \item Designed and deployed a scalable signal-based system to identify and escalate
              malicious actors, coordinating with SMEs, engineering, legal, policy, and
              investigative teams to ensure high precision and recall; defined performance
              metrics, established infrastructure for decision-making and accountability,
              and influenced the system's adoption across other problem spaces.
              %
        \item Developed AI system to detect and modify egregious content to minimize
              psychological impact on content moderators, improving employee retention
              and review speed; led cross-functional collaboration with design, legal,
              and product teams to align on requirements, execution, and deployment.
              %
        \item Defined analytical requirements and collaborated with our human reviewer
              operations team to design a testing procedure for identifying miscalibration
              in an updated sexual exploitation policy; conducted statistical analysis of
              results, delivering insights to refine policy wording and improve precision.
              %
        \item Migrated file processing system for critical actor tracking pipelines to
              modern infrastructure, improving performance and interoperability with
              investigative tooling.
              %
        \item Triaged and resolved technical incidents and reputational escalations across
              an ecosystem of hundreds of legacy data pipelines, tools, and systems, balancing
              rapid fixes with long-term systemic solutions.
              %
        \item Mentored new hires as an onboarding lead, curating tasks and projects to
              guide their understanding of internal workflows and tooling while
              facilitating connections with key teams; conducted coding interviews to
              evaluate applicants and promote team growth.

        \item Developed a novel application of a generic account clustering system to identify and
              classify decentralized conspiracy networks, driving one of the largest takedowns
              of a dangerous conspiracy movement in the company's history.
              %
        \item Designed and implemented integrations with vendors and OSINT data sources, enhancing
              internal tooling to improve situational awareness and off-platform coverage for
              investigations; collaborated with vendor-management teams to secure data access.
