    \begin{itemize}
        \item Served as engineering lead on trust \& safety intelligence teams across multiple
              problem spaces; prototyped tools, standardized workflows across teams, and
              advocated investigator needs to external engineering teams to influence scaled solutions.
              %
        \item Created a classification system to define malicious behavior; directed alignment of
              subject matter expert decision making, defined performance metrics with policy teams,
              built infrastructure to aggregate technical and manual decisions, and managed deployment
              to human review teams.
              %
        \item Developed an AI system to detect and modify egregious content to minimize psychological
              impact on content moderators, improving employee retention and review speed; led
              cross-functional collaboration with design, legal, product, and review operations
              teams to align on requirements, execution, and deployment.
              %
        \item Defined analytical requirements and collaborated with our human reviewer
              operations team to design a testing procedure for identifying miscalibration
              in an updated sexual exploitation policy; conducted statistical analysis of
              results, delivering insights to refine policy wording and improve precision.
              %
        \item Migrated file processing system for critical actor tracking pipelines to
              modern infrastructure, improving performance and interoperability with
              investigative tooling.
              %
        \item Triaged and resolved technical incidents and reputational escalations across
              an ecosystem of hundreds of legacy data pipelines, tools, and systems, balancing
              rapid fixes with long-term systemic solutions.
              %
        \item Mentored new hires by curating onboarding tasks and facilitating connections with
              key teams; conducted coding interviews to evaluate applicants and promote team growth.
